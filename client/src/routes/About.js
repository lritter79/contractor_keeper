            Contractor Keeper makes it easier for contractors and their customers to keep track of their warranties.
            We do this by letting contractors use a simple user interfaces to enter all the information they would have to keep track of in a warranty,
            and let the contractor and client simply store the warranty as a smart contract on the block chain. 
            This way, the warranty can't be lost, destroyed, or manipulated in bad faith by either party.

            And for insurance companies and home buyers, Contractor Keeper makes it easy to see the whole history of homes.
